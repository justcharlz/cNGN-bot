## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hardcoded Private Key Exposure
**File:** `bot/config.py:12`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Complete loss of funds

```python
DUMMY_PRIVATE_KEY = os.getenv("PRIVATE_KEY", "0xaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa")
```

**Issue:** The fallback private key is hardcoded and publicly visible. If the environment variable is not set, the bot uses this known private key.

**Attack Vector:** Anyone can derive the wallet address and drain funds.

**Recommendation:**
- Remove hardcoded fallback private key
- Fail fast if PRIVATE_KEY environment variable is not set
- Use hardware wallets or secure key management systems for production

### 2. Exposed API Keys in Source Code
**File:** `stats/data.py:9`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** API key compromise, service disruption

```python
RPC_URL = "https://base-mainnet.infura.io/v3/35fbbf13c9134267aa47e7acd9242abf"
```

**Issue:** Infura API key is hardcoded in source code and likely committed to version control.

**Attack Vector:** API key abuse, rate limiting, potential billing fraud.

**Recommendation:**
- Move all API keys to environment variables
- Rotate compromised API keys immediately
- Use API key restrictions (IP allowlisting, domain restrictions)

### 3. Unlimited Token Approvals
**File:** `bot/utils/dex_utils.py:352,490`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Unlimited token exposure

```python
MAX_UINT256 = 2**256 - 1
# Used for token approvals
```

**Issue:** Bot approves maximum possible token amounts to contracts, creating unlimited exposure.

**Attack Vector:** If approved contracts are compromised, all tokens can be drained.

**Recommendation:**
- Use just-in-time approvals for exact amounts needed
- Implement approval limits and periodic revocation
- Monitor approval events for suspicious activity

### 4. Zero Slippage Protection
**File:** `bot/strategy.py:313-314`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Sandwich attacks, MEV exploitation

```python
amount0_min = 0 # Slippage control: min amount of token0 to provide
amount1_min = 0 # Slippage control: min amount of token1 to provide
```

**Issue:** All transactions use zero slippage protection, making them vulnerable to MEV attacks.

**Attack Vector:** Sandwich attacks can extract significant value from every transaction.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement dynamic slippage calculation based on market conditions
- Use minimum 0.5-1% slippage protection
- Consider using MEV protection services

### 5. Single Point of Failure for Price Data
**File:** `bot/price_provider.py:18-61`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Price manipulation, incorrect trading decisions

**Issue:** Bot relies solely on on-chain swap events for price data without external validation.

**Attack Vector:** Large swaps or flash loan attacks can manipulate the price feed, causing incorrect rebalancing.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement multiple price sources (Chainlink, Uniswap TWAP, external APIs)
- Add price deviation checks and circuit breakers
- Use time-weighted average prices (TWAP) for decision making

### 6. No Access Controls
**File:** Multiple files  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Unauthorized operations

**Issue:** No authentication or authorization mechanisms exist. Anyone can potentially interact with bot functions.

**Attack Vector:** Malicious actors could trigger unwanted operations if endpoints are exposed.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement role-based access controls
- Add authentication for administrative functions
- Use multi-signature wallets for critical operations

### 7. Reentrancy Vulnerabilities
**File:** `bot/utils/dex_utils.py:346-423`  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Potential fund drainage

**Issue:** External contract calls in `mint_new_position` and other functions lack reentrancy protection.

**Attack Vector:** Malicious contracts could exploit callback functions to drain funds.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement reentrancy guards
- Use checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Validate all external contract calls

**File:** `bot/strategy.py:290-346`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Invalid transactions, fund loss

**Issue:** Missing validation for tick ranges, amounts, and other critical parameters.

**Recommendation:**
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Implement parameter bounds checking
- Validate tick alignment with tick spacing

### 9. Gas Estimation Attack Vectors
**File:** `bot/utils/dex_utils.py:200-210`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Transaction failures, griefing attacks

**Issue:** No upper bounds on gas estimation, vulnerable to gas estimation attacks.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement maximum gas limits
- Add gas price validation
- Use gas estimation with safety margins

### 10. Front-running Exposure
**File:** `bot/strategy.py:467-489`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** MEV extraction, reduced profits

**Issue:** Predictable transaction patterns make the bot vulnerable to front-running.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement transaction randomization
- Use commit-reveal schemes
- Consider private mempools

### 11. Oracle Manipulation Risks
**File:** `bot/price_provider.py:43-57`  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Incorrect price data, bad trading decisions

**Issue:** Price calculation relies on single swap events without manipulation checks.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement price deviation detection
- Use multiple oracle sources
- Add circuit breakers for extreme price movements

### 12. Missing Emergency Controls
**File:** `bot/strategy.py` (entire file)  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Inability to stop operations during attacks

**Issue:** No emergency pause or shutdown mechanisms exist.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement emergency pause functionality
- Add kill switches for critical operations
- Create emergency withdrawal procedures
